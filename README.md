Simon Says was created on the 7th of Novemeber 2020. It has since been verified by on Discord and is on many bot lists! This bot is actually certified on [Discord Boats](https://discord.boats)! It is currently being managed by Grinder#0001 and community managers in the bot and support server. If you need help, we have a [Support Server](https://discord.gg/5FX9MhG). Now that I've given you basic information, lets see what I can do:

- I have easy setup commands (s!setup & s!chan-setup)
- I have type and flip commands (no more bias 50/50's!)
- I have enter and eliminate commands (to keep the flow of the game going)
- I have shoot and votekick commands (1/4 chance of surving a shot, 5 votes to get a Simon votekicked!)
- Mobile Support Team, to help you anywhere, anytime
- No command vote locks/premium features! (Not pay 2 win, extremely fair)
- We block toxic people, let's keep the fun going!
- We partner & affiliate with communites we like, rewarding them.
